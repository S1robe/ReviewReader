   - "5 layers of IP stack, what are responsibilities"
   - "What is message, segement, datagram, frame?"
   - "What layers does a router process, link layer, host process?"
  Answers:
    - "There is no difference"
    - "Common way for unrelated objects to communicate."
    - "Without standards we wouldnt have a common way to communicate."
    - "Wifi: home, enterprise; Optical Fiber: enterprise; HFC: home; radio (3-5g): WideArea; dial-up"
    - "HFC is shared, and therefore could have collision delays if users downloaded at the exact same time."
    - "HFC: 50mpbs up, 300mpbs down, 99.99$; Optical Fiber: 500mpbs up, 2gbps down, 129.99$"
    - "Based on Cat: 10M, 100M 1G, 10G"
    - "Twisted pair, coax, optical fiber"
    - "DSL DedicatedDown: (.05, 1M), Up: (4, 50K); HFC ShrdDown: 240D,30UM, 31.2DG, 100UM, FTTH: 2-10UM 10-20DM1"
    - "Popular is 3/4G & Wifi (802.11), Both mediums are unguided sending packets out over radio bands. Beucase 3/4G is a bigger band than wifi a user can be 10's of km away and still be connected, wifi must be within 10'sm. Wifi uses an AP (Access point), but 3/4G doesnt, instead packets are recieved and processed over the same infrastructure as cellular telephones."
    - "L/R1 + L/R2"
    - "Circuit swithced is guaranteed bandwidth, packet doesnt have this. FDM is complicated to shift the signal into bands. TDM is simpler."
    - "a. Since each one requires 1mpbs, 2 users; b. with 2 users, each user is 1mbps, and link is 2 mbps, 1 *2 /2 = 1, no Qing delay. But for 3: since each one uses 1mbps, 3/2 > 1, so there is Qing delay. c. 0.2;  d..2^3 = 0.008, fraction of time for Q grow is same, 0.008"
    - "a. Peering shared network traffic reducing the load on both providers and the cost to both because they will need an intermediary ISP. b. IXP's earn money by charging ISPs a small fee to talk to each other, which is typically a fee based on traffic."
    - "Google is a content provider, having many data centers and blade servers inside these centers which perform the work of a traditional ISP. All of their traffic is private, and therefore free to them, because its all over their networks, not an intermediary. Being this large, enables them to bypass 3rd party ISP's and makes it cheaper on Google. This also enabels them to control the user experience as they control from source to destination."
    - "Processing delay: Constant, Qing Delay: Variable, Transmission Delay: Constant, Propagation Delay: Constant"
    - "(2500 * 1000)/(2.5 * 10 ^8) = 0.01s = 10ms, d/s, no, no"
    - "a. 500kbps b. 64 seconds c. 100 kbps, 320 "
    - "A first reads the data of the file into chunks, which then makes multiple packets from the file. Each of the packets have the source (A's IP) IP and the dest IP (B's IP). The packet switch then reads the dest IP and determines which link to send that over. Then it is forwarded to B."
    - "Error Control, flow control, encapsulation, multiplexing, connection setup. Yes multiple layers may have error control."
    - "App=Messages, handles application communication; Transport, handles method of transit (TCP/UDP); Network, handles routing across networks via IP; Link, handles routing between hosts on same network, physical, bit propagation."
    - "Application message is the data that an app wants to send somewhere; Transport layer segment is the app message with a transport layer header attached specifying communication protcol Network datagram is the segment enccapsulated with the network layer's header. Link Frame is the network datagram with a link-layer header."
    - "Router processes a datagram, layers 1-3; Link layer processes 1-2, and host processes all 5."
